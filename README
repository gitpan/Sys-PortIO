This is Sys::PortIO, a Perl interface to direct port I/O functions
(on Unix-like systems, inb() and outb() and friends).
You can install it in the typical CPAN module manner:

NAME

    Sys::PortIO - perform direct port I/O from Perl

SYNOPSIS

        use Sys::PortIO;

        port_open($portnum);
        write_byte($portnum, $value);
        $value = read_byte($portnum);
        port_close($portnum);

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a Perl interface to the low-level port I/O
    operations provided by Linux, FreeBSD, or OpenBSD. Among other things,
    this is useful for writing Perl scripts that interface with parallel,
    serial, or joystick ports.

BUGS

    On some systems (for example, Linux), doing a port read or write on an
    unopened port will cause a segmentation fault.

TODO

    Support optional range argument to "port_open()".
    Set $! on errors, instead of dying (sometimes with a segfault).
    Alternately, automatically open ports as needed.

    On Linux or other glibc systems, see ioperm(2), inb(2), and outb(2).
    FreeBSD uses /dev/io for port access. On OpenBSD and NetBSD, see
    i386_iopl(2) and sysarch(2).
